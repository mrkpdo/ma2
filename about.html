    <div class = "bio"> Shunji Iwai is a Japanese film director, video artist, writer and documentary maker. He was born in Sendai, Miyagi, Japan, starting in the Japenese entertainment industry in 1988, directing TV dramas and music videos. In 1995, he started his career in feature films, starting with the box office hit "Love Letter," creating an impact in other east Asian countries. Iwai is commonly recognized for his distinctive and innovative visual style, describing himself as an "eizo sakka" or a visual artist, his characters and plot themes are often excellently developed in his films, all of which he has personally scripted. Often called a trend-setter, he has created a style that resonates with Japanese pop culture, striking a chord with contemporary Japanese youth, especially young women. Although Iwai's films have been well received and awarded in film festivals in and outside of Japan, notably in Toronto and Berlin, he and his films are not yet well known outside of Asia.</div>
